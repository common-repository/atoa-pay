Reduces chargebacks and payment gateway costs: When customers make payments using their mobile banking it reduces your overall payment gateway costs.
Provides instant settlements: Atoa Pay provides instant settlements, which means that you will receive the funds from your customers' payments immediately. This can improve your cash flow and help you to manage your finances more effectively.
Effortless 3-Step Integration: Seamlessly integrate Atoa Pay into your website or online store with just three simple clicks. Begin by installing the plugin, then generate your API key, and finally, toggle on Atoa Pay within the woo-commerce payment settings. It's that easy!
